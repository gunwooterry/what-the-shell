# WhatTheShell

**Tool for Linux beginners to learn shell commands**

WhatTheShell is a translator between GUI actions and shell commands.
Actions like click and double-click, copying and removing files are translated to corresponding commands, and vice versa.
It currently supports basic Bash commands (e.g. `mv`, `cp`, `rm`).
